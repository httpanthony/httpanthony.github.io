    <h2>I introduce to you, my Final Project, Simon says. Simon says is a fun childhood game in which the players must follow every order that begins with "Simon says." A order that doesn't start with "Simon says" means don't do it. Anyone who violates one of these two rules does not gain points. We put a little spin on our version of this game, we have color squares which rotates at a random time, clicking on the correct color in the amount if time given you score a point and accumalting enough points will result in victory. Another element we impelemented was another game mode called keyboard mode, where you use your keyboards instead of the mouse to follow the command.  </h2>
