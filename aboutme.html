<p> Hi, I'm Anthony Sarpong, I go by Ant and this is about me. Born and raised in Koforifua, Ghana- came to the United States when I was 13. Since a kid I've always been fascinated about how
        things worked. WHich lead to numeous of my toys being destroyed, but when I'm playing surgeon, I listen to music often, play videogames, and go on late night drives. 
        Another talent of mine includes drawing, painting, and designinig clothes.</p>
