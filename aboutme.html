        <p><img id="sarpong.jpg"> Hi, I'm Anthony Sarpong, I go by Ant and this is about me. Born and raised in Koforifua, Ghana- came to the United States when I was 13. Since a kid I've always been fascinated about how
        things worked. Which lead to numeous of my toys being destroyed, but when I'm playing surgeon, I listen to music often, play videogames, and go on late night drives. 
        Another talent of mine includes drawing, painting, and designinig clothes.</p>
       
        <p><img id="hobby.jpg"> A hooby of mine that I enjoy is working out, I spend most of my downtime at the gym. Working helps me relief stress and also stay in shape.</p>
      
    
    <p><img id="hobby1.jpg"> Another hooby of mine that I enjoy is gaming, since a little kid I've spent countless of hours on video games. Currently I am playiung, Call of Duty cold war, NBA 2k21, and NFS Heat. </p>
