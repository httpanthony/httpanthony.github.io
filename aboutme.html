        things worked. Which lead to numeous of my toys being destroyed, but when I'm playing surgeon, I listen to music often, play videogames, and go on late night drives. 
        Another talent of mine includes drawing, painting, and designinig clothes.</p>
       
        <p><img id="hobby.jpg"> A hooby of mine that I enjoy is working out, I spend most of my downtime at the gym. Working helps me relief stress and also stay in shape.</p>
